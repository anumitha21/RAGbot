The basic hypothesis of this work is that such\\nan entity does exist. Both concepts, space and time, are generally given as such;\\ntheir existence is not discussed, but justiﬁed in terms of a priori statements,\\ni.e. they have the status of subjective data. This is so since Aristotle. Kant\\nhas obviously reinforced such a trend: “Space is not something objective and\\nreal, nor a substance, nor an accident, nor a relation; instead, it is subjective\\nand ideal, and originates from the mind’s nature in accord with a stable law as\\na scheme, as it were, for coordinating everything sensed externally.” (cited from\\n[1]). For physicists (Galileo, Newton), space and time are absolute entities.\\nFor an introduction to space and time concepts through the centuries, see [2,\\n3]. Einstein posits that space and time belong to the same conceptual frame\\n(spacetime, since), a change of great signiﬁcance, but he does not raise the issues\\nneither of their origin nor of their ontology. In fact, as rightly claimed by Wilczek\\n[4], Einstein’s spacetime is an avatar of the Ether. Its status has not much\\nchanged with the current cosmological theories; the Big Bang is considered to\\noccur in an already existing empty Lorentzian spacetime, the attempts to build\\na static, inﬁnite, with no beginning and no end, continuously created Universe\\n[5, 6] have been abandoned. I do not expatiate ... .\\nOn the other hand, a number of attempts to unify the concepts of gravitation\\nand those of quantum mechanics have yielded a few models of the formation\\nof spacetime. We mention here two of them that have somewhat inspired our\\npresentation: 1)- Sorkin and coll., see e.g. [7], with the building of a spacetime\\nmade of discrete elements, linked by a set of causality relations, these events\\nbeing embedded in an underlying Lorentzian manifold. 2)- Smolin and coll., see\\ne.g. [8], who attach a four-momentum to each element of the foregoing kind.\\nHereunder we assume that time and space proceed together from a mecha-\\nnism of apparition of spacetime entities −to be described in some detail−which\\nconstruct the Universe U in size, matter content, topology, from a preUniverse\\nreservoir RU devoid of time and space ; thereby R U ignores the notion of di-\\nmensionality. Attempts have already been done to conceive the creation of the\\nuniverse from nothing, see e.g. [9, 10]. R U could be this nothingness, but it is\\nendowed with speciﬁc properties and, ﬁrst of all, it is a set of elements (in the\\n2'),\n",

In\\nthis process time and space emerge. The transfer of elements from the reservoir\\nRU to the Universe U is irreversible.

According to Zermelo, any set so deﬁned (space and time concepts being\\nabsent) can be well-ordered [12] (this is also known as the axiom of choice ). We\\nmake use of this theorem: Sis a set that can be well-ordered. In other words\\nit makes sense to choose a ﬁrst ur-element, then a second, and so on, and in\\nthis way to order all the ur-elements starting from a ﬁrst one. This structural\\nproperty is usually indicated as follows:\\na≺b≺c≺... (1)\\nwhere a, ﬁrst chosen, precedes b, which precedes c, and so on. That process is\\nset in ‘outside’ RU, and this sequential apparition builds U: we call it a Zermelo\\nprocess. We argue that it gives some validity to the concept of time, see also [8];\\nthe interval in the sequence of choices can be interpreted as a unit time lapse.\\nThus time separates from space. This is reminiscent of the cosmological principle,\\naccording to which time and space are decoupled.\\nThe question of the embedding of the sequence of spacetime entities into a\\nLorentzian manifold has been much discussed. More precisely, Sorkin and coll.\\n[7, 13] have considered a partially ordered set of such entities, a poset, called\\na causet if given a causal structure, (the class of posets includes obviously the\\nsubclass of linear order sets under consideration in Eq. 1) with a Poisson dis-\\ntribution embedded into a Lorentzian manifold. We shall hypothesize that the\\nZermelo process RU →U builds such a discrete set of entities with its Lorentzian\\nembedding. The fundamental property of a causet is indeed that it implies the\\nLorentz group [14]. The essential addition we make to the theories of Sorkin\\nand coll. and of Smolin and coll. is an analysis of the thermodynamic prop-\\nerties of this process. Their use of a partially ordered set instead of a linearly\\nordered set is valid equally well in the framework of our model, yielding subsets\\nof simultaneously appearing spacetime elements, but there is no necessity for\\nthis complication in the frame of the operation we describe.\\n2.2 algorithmic entropy of the ur-elements\\nOne cannot attach an entropy to the set S of ur-elements in R U since there\\nare no space coordinates neither time: the notion of randomness is absent, the\\nentropy of disorder is vanishing.

The\\nso-called ‘extremal’ black holes, which obey Eq. 13 and Eq. 14 with the equality\\nsign, do not Hawking-evaporate and are consequently stable [28]. It has also\\nbeen suggested that there may be ‘relics’ formed before the Big Bang, in a cyclic\\nuniverse [29, 30]. This latter suggestion is in a sense not in contradiction with\\nour model. Finally it has been advanced that they constitute a large part of dark\\nmatter [31, 32]. According to ref. [26], the characteristic time of the Hawking\\nevaporation of a micro black hole (of Planckian size) is of ordertch = 4.8×104 tP.\\nThis seems to be large enough to justify the calculated distribution, inasmuch\\nas a small number of ‘particles’ suﬃces for a fast convergence of the summations\\nEq. 12, as already stated.\\nA remark about extremal black holes.

Its introduc-\\ntion in physics requires the use of a profound theorem of the mathematical set\\ntheory, −this part of mathematics ﬁnds here some application to physics for\\nthe ﬁrst time, whereas there is seemingly no other domain of mathematics that\\ncould not ﬁnd already some application. But the consideration of R U has this\\nadvantage over the multiverse to predict a negative pressure p = −ε Eq. 3, a\\nsmall entropy (one bit per entity), a decoupling of (cosmic) time and space,\\nand to yield a reasonable Big Bang temperature, taken the magnitude of the\\nmass-energy of the observable universe at the present epoch. The only point\\nwhere it diﬀers from the standard theory is that the Big Bang is in the present\\ntheory an everlasting process, with however an origin, the apparition of the ﬁrst\\nspacetime entity in the Zermelo sequence Eq. 1, −thus the name of Big Bang\\nis not overindulged. This diﬀerence is worth a future investigation. Notice that\\nthe present results belong to a trans-Planckian domain, but obtain from very\\nsimple thermodynamical arguments. A complete theory of quantum gravity im-\\nplying space and time as emergent entities is still missing, but see [33]. It would\\nperhaps give a more physical signiﬁcance to R U, which might be nothing more\\nthan a representation at the classical level of a sub-Planckian object.\\nA remark about the one-bit entropy per EBH; it would mean, if interpreted\\nin terms of statistical physics, that there are only two microstates pertaining to\\na EBH. Which microstates? The present favored interpretation is in terms of\\nquantum entanglement, as ﬁrst proposed by Bombelli et al. [34], for a review\\nsee [35]. This entropy would then measure the quantum correlations between\\nthe exterior and the interior states. It is intriguing to remark that all those\\nstates, whatever their distance in U, whatever indeed the non-locality of their\\ninteractions, are in contact with R U, where the concepts of distance and time\\nare absent. This speciﬁc nature of non-locality in our model can well be related\\nto the non-local eﬀects observed experimentally, seee.g. [36]. The same remarks\\nshould apply to any kind of spacetime entity whose entropy stems in quantum\\nentanglement.\\n13'),\n",

The second law\\nmust be understood as ruling the transfer of entropy from RU to U, which\\nis as small as one bit i.e., kB ln 2 per spacetime entity.

The basic hypothesis of this work is that such\\nan entity does exist. Both concepts, space and time, are generally given as such;\\ntheir existence is not discussed, but justiﬁed in terms of a priori statements,\\ni.e. they have the status of subjective data. This is so since Aristotle. Kant\\nhas obviously reinforced such a trend: “Space is not something objective and\\nreal, nor a substance, nor an accident, nor a relation; instead, it is subjective\\nand ideal, and originates from the mind’s nature in accord with a stable law as\\na scheme, as it were, for coordinating everything sensed externally.” (cited from\\n[1]). For physicists (Galileo, Newton), space and time are absolute entities.\\nFor an introduction to space and time concepts through the centuries, see [2,\\n3]. Einstein posits that space and time belong to the same conceptual frame\\n(spacetime, since), a change of great signiﬁcance, but he does not raise the issues\\nneither of their origin nor of their ontology. In fact, as rightly claimed by Wilczek\\n[4], Einstein’s spacetime is an avatar of the Ether.

The\\nexistence and stability of EBHs has been much debated recently, the question\\nbeing whether or not they disappear by the process of Hawking evaporation.\\nIt has been advanced that evaporation could cease at Planck scales, yielding\\n‘remnants’, in reason of a generalized uncertainty principle [26] or the eﬀects of\\nextra-dimensions and quantum-gravitational spacetime ﬂuctuations [27]. The\\nso-called ‘extremal’ black holes, which obey Eq. 13 and Eq. 14 with the equality\\nsign, do not Hawking-evaporate and are consequently stable [28]. It has also\\nbeen suggested that there may be ‘relics’ formed before the Big Bang, in a cyclic\\nuniverse [29, 30]. This latter suggestion is in a sense not in contradiction with\\nour model. Finally it has been advanced that they constitute a large part of dark\\nmatter [31, 32]. According to ref. [26], the characteristic time of the Hawking\\nevaporation of a micro black hole (of Planckian size) is of ordertch = 4.8×104 tP.\\nThis seems to be large enough to justify the calculated distribution, inasmuch\\nas a small number of ‘particles’ suﬃces for a fast convergence of the summations\\nEq. 12, as already stated.\\nA remark about extremal black holes.

Its introduc-\\ntion in physics requires the use of a profound theorem of the mathematical set\\ntheory, −this part of mathematics ﬁnds here some application to physics for\\nthe ﬁrst time, whereas there is seemingly no other domain of mathematics that\\ncould not ﬁnd already some application. But the consideration of R U has this\\nadvantage over the multiverse to predict a negative pressure p = −ε Eq. 3, a\\nsmall entropy (one bit per entity), a decoupling of (cosmic) time and space,\\nand to yield a reasonable Big Bang temperature, taken the magnitude of the\\nmass-energy of the observable universe at the present epoch. The only point\\nwhere it diﬀers from the standard theory is that the Big Bang is in the present\\ntheory an everlasting process, with however an origin, the apparition of the ﬁrst\\nspacetime entity in the Zermelo sequence Eq. 1, −thus the name of Big Bang\\nis not overindulged. This diﬀerence is worth a future investigation. Notice that\\nthe present results belong to a trans-Planckian domain, but obtain from very\\nsimple thermodynamical arguments. A complete theory of quantum gravity im-\\nplying space and time as emergent entities is still missing, but see [33].

       "'This equation of state is well-established in cosmology and is considered at the\\norigin of the inﬂation of the universe [19] at its very early beginning. It is strictly\\nvalid at the ﬁrst appearing spacetime entity, when V = 0.\\nThe foregoing considerations do not provide the R U →U Zermelo process\\nwith special features and are not very appealing, except for the existence of\\na negative pressure. Generally, the thermodynamic equilibrium between two\\nsystems in contact implies the equality of the temperatures Ta = Tb and of the\\nchemical potentials µa = µb. The assumption that R U and U are in equilibrium\\nis a notion diﬃcult to assess insofar as there is no geometrical contact (but in\\na sense R U and U are in contact everywhere where U exists) and furthermore\\nthere is no deﬁned temperature in R U. As stated above, the chemical potential\\nand the temperature of a relativistic system in thermodynamic equilibrium are\\nnot constrained to be spatially constant; but the ratioµ/T has to be. This latter\\nremark suggests a solution to this puzzle; we shall assume that the quantityµ/T\\nrelative to the spacetime entities is not only constant through a given spatial\\nUniverse at a given cosmic time, but is constant in time, by reason of the status\\nof RU. This constancy expresses the equilibrium of U with the reservoir R U.\\n3.3 the entropy of a spacetime entity\\nThe variation of the internal energy of the Universe with time contains two\\ncontributions, one from the already N existing spacetime elements, i.e. the\\nHubble’s expansion, one from the appearance of dN new entities emerging from\\nthe reservoir, see Eq. 4 . All together one has:\\ndE(= TdS −pdV + µdN) = d(Nεv). (6)\\nIntroducing the mean entropy per object s, S = Ns, this equation also\\nreads:\\n(µ+ sT)dN + N(Tds −pdv) −pvdN −d(Nεv) = 0. (7)\\nThis expression can be simpliﬁed by employing the Gibbs-Duhem relation\\ndµ= −sdT + vdp (where dµis the same for all the spacetime entities), thereby'"

       "'This paper proposes a model for the formation of the universe, built on the idea that there exists a pre-universe reservoir, denoted as RU, lacking space and time dimensions. \\n\\nHere are the key points:\\n\\n* **RU and the Universe (U):** The universe (U) emerges from RU through the \"apparition\" of spacetime entities. \\n* **Thermodynamics:** The model applies the second law of thermodynamics and the principle of conservation of energy to the closed system U ∪ RU.  \\n* **Entropy Transfer:** The second law dictates that entropy flows from RU to U. Each spacetime entity contributes an entropy of kB ln 2.\\n* **Spacetime Entities:** These entities are interpreted as elementary black holes (EBHs) at the Planck scale. They possess various properties like angular momentum and electric charge, and their distribution follows a Boltzmann distribution.\\n* **Temperature of Apparition:**  Assuming the total mass-energy of EBHs equals the observable universe\\'s mass-energy, the model calculates a temperature (T) of approximately 4.1 times the Planck temperature, which is the temperature at which spacetime entities allegedly appeared.\\n* **Non-Local Interactions:** The model suggests that RU\\'s existence, lacking time and space, could explain non-local interactions observed in the universe.\\n\\n\\nEssentially, the paper proposes a novel framework for understanding the universe\\'s origin by positing a pre-existing reservoir (RU) from which spacetime and its fundamental constituents (EBHs) emerge. \\n'"
